# Lab 5 Reflection


By improving the old code, I found that some coding habits are very important.

The first is annotations. Without comments, it is very difficult to read the code, even if it is written by yourself. Even the code I wrote yesterday may not be understood. It takes more time to understand uncommented code than to rewrite the code. So it is very important to develop a good habit of writing good comments, sometimes even more important than writing the code itself. So in improving the old code this time, I modified a lot of comments to make the code easier to understand. It is also convenient to review the code by yourself.

The second is the name of the variable. Sometimes the name of the variable is poorly named, which hinders the understanding of the code. It is important to use variable names well. When used well, you can immediately understand the role of variables without even looking at the comments.

The third is the cleanliness and indentation of the code. Good typography can facilitate code reading. So I organized the code into blocks to facilitate the understanding of their logical relationship.

Finally, optimize the code. Streamline some heavy and inefficient code. Or rewrite the logically complex and difficult code in a clearer way to make the code easier to understand. Except for code that requires efficiency.

After re-reading my old code, I can better understand the incomprehensible parts of the code. Therefore modify and add more easily understandable comments to make it more conducive to code reading. This saves time and improves efficiency for the next reading. Because it takes a certain amount of time to re-understand the old code, the shorter the time, the better. And correct annotations and good coding habits can reduce this time cost.
